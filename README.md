# correct

> A systematic and scalable approach to fixing and avoiding incorrectness and mistakes.

Incorrectness and mistakes are enemies of productive software development. They cause problems which affect us and our users, and consume time and energy to find and put right.

The opportunities for them to arise and the impact they have, tends to grow with codebase and team size. Manual detection and correction through meticulous code review and testing doesn't scale well, and consumes focus better spent elsewhere.

The approach:

1. Take an incorrectness or mistake that happened
1. Find out what caused it
1. Create a "once and for all" automated solution to (help) prevent it happening again
